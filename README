Ontology Toolchain
==================

The ontology toolchain (ontc) is a set of software development tools.
It uses ontologies to support the development of software.

Build
-----

The following software is used to build ontc:

 * GCC 10.2.0 (https://gcc.gnu.org/)
 * GNU Make 4.3 (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 * GNU Bison 3.7.2 (https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
 * flex 2.6.4 (https://github.com/westes/flex)

All software versions mentioned above are no minimum versions but
recommendations because ontc can be successfully compiled using
these versions.

In order to build ontc just run:

	mkdir build
	make

The binary will be located in the build/ directory.
